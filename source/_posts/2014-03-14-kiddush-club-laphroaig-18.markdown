Well, looks like friday kiddush club in the office will be back on now that friday's are longer. We're not officially back in business yet but there is a sampling of a personal collection today: Laphrooaig 18 year. It's a rich, warm, smoky taste. Considering how strong it is in the mouth, it's surprisingly not noticeable in the throat. Would happily drink it again.
