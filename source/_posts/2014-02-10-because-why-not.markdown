Always sorta kinda wanted to have a blog. Generally shyed away from the idea.
But Scott Hanselman [convinced me](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YourBlogIsTheEngineOfCommunity.aspx "Your Blog is The Engine of Community").
At least initially, this will be a dumping ground. 
I assume it will feature mostly incoherent, half-complete sentences about coding. 
Hopefully every once in a while there will be slightly more coherent ideas.
And I'm guessing it won't all focus on code either.

Good night, and keep watching the skis.
